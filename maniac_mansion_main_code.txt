;========================================================
; Room graphics
;========================================================
; The visible room (what I call the "room scene") is not stored as a full frame of individual pixels, as would usually happen on modern machines. 
; Due to technology limitations, "tiles" are used, which can be reused and repeated.
; This is very similar to the way the NES/Famicom handles graphics (with name tables, patterns, etc.).
;
; In this way, one can define the tiles first and then compose them as a "mosaic".
; A "tile layer" is used to represent the mosaic of tiles, by using 1 byte per tile.
; This allows a maximum of 256 different tiles.
; 
; A crude example of a 2x6 tile layer would be:
;
; 	0	1	1	0	2	54
;	32	32	30	49  42  99
;
; Each room scene has a tile layer, then, whose dimensions are exactly: room_width * room_height, as the dimensions are expressed in tile units.
;
; Tile definitions are stored in one section. There's actually always 128 tiles defined for each room (even if some are unused).
; Each tile represents a 4x8 group of pixels, where each pixel takes 2 bits (to specify multiple colors). 
; It thus occupies: 4x8x2 bits = 64 bits = 8 bytes.
;
; 2 bits per pixel would allow 4 different color values.
; To allow more colors, one of the 4 values is used to represent a "foreground" color, and the other 3 correspond to 3 different "background" palette colors.
; This can be summarized as:
;
;		Bit value		Color represented
;		=========		=================
;			00			Background color #0
;			01			Background color #1
;			10			Background color #2
;			11			Foreground color
;
;
; An example of a tile's pixels could be:
;
;		BG0	BG0	BG1 BG0
;		FG	FG	BG2 BG2
;		FG	FG	BG2 BG0
;		FG	FG	FG	FG
;		FG	FG	FG	FG
;		BG0	BG0	BG0	BG0
;		BG1	BG1	BG1	BG1
;		BG2	BG2	BG2	BG2
;
;	Where	FG = foreground color
;			BG0 = background color 0
;			BG1 = background color 1
;			BG2 = background color 2
;
; This would be represented in bits as:
;
;		00	00	01	00
;		11	11	10	10
;		11	11	10	00
;		11	11	11	11
;		11	11	11	11
;		00	00	00	00	
;		01	01	01	01
;		10	10	10	10
;
; The different foreground colors are taken from a subset of the C64's palette of 16 possible colors. 
; Specifically, 8 of those 16 can be used. This means the foreground color index requires 3 bits.
; As clearly 3 bits don't fit into 1, these other 3 bits have to be stored somewhere.
;
; The C64 uses a separate "color layer" (also referred to as Color RAM) to store the foreground colors.
; The color layer has exactly the same dimensions as the tile layer. 
; Each byte in the color layer defines the foreground color used for that particular tile position.
; Note that only 3 bits are used, instead of 8, for the foreground color, so bits 7-3 are ignored.
; 
; To continue with the previous example, these are an invented example of tile and color layers:
;
;	Tile layer positions			Tile layer values
;
; 	T00 T01 T02 T03 T04 T05			0	1	1	0   2   54
;	T10	T11 T12 T13 T14 T15			32	32	30	49  42  99
;
;	Color layer	positions			Color layer values
;
;	C00	C01	C02	C03	C04	C05			3	3	3	1	0	1
;	C10	C11	C12	C13	C14	C15			5	7	2	2	2	1
;
;	Note: Txy means Tile index at tile row x, tile column y. Same thing for Cxy.
;
; So at tile row 1, tile column 2, the value at position T12 will be used for the tile, and the value at position C12 will be used for the foreground color.
; This would be tile number 30 and foreground color 2.
;
; To tie everything up with actual colors, let's consider these background colors for our example:
;
;	BG color 0:		1 (white)
;	BG color 1:		6 (blue)
;	BG color 2:		0 (black)
;
; At tile position T12, C12 has value 2, which is the color red.
; Then the real colors used for the tile, when rendered at tile position row 1, column 2, would be: white, blue, black (for the BG colors) and red (for the FG color)
;
;		white	white	blue	white
;		red		red		black	black
;		red		red		black	white
;		red		red		red		red
;		red		red		red		red
;		white	white	white	white
;		blue	blue	blue	blue
;		black 	black 	black 	black
;
; To save storage space, these 2 layers (the tile and color layers), as well as the tile definitions, are stored compressed on disk.
; The 3 background colors are part of the room's data.


;========================================================
; Graphics masking
;========================================================
; To allow the depiction of depth, actors can move in front of or behind certain parts of the background, or certain objects.
; By default, the actors graphics are copied on top of whatever is in the background.
; But when the actor is behind a graphic layer, its graphics need to be obstructed by the foreground.
; This is achieved by storing information about the foreground in a separate layer.
; The foreground graphics need to "mask" the actor's graphics.
;
; It's not necessary to fully duplicate the background pixels into the foreground (that is, tiles, colors and tile patterns).
; The simple algorithm used is:
;
;	-draw the background fully
;       -draw the actor's graphics fully into the invisible buffer
;	-get masking information for the actor's position
;	-mask out the actor's graphics in the buffer as needed
;	-toggle the invisible sprite buffer to the current active sprite
;
; If an actor's pixel is masked, then it's not drawn to the scene, and the background pixel remains visible.
; Otherwise, the actor's pixel is drawn on the scene, obstructing the background pixel.
;
; For example, this is a hypothetical 8x8 mask pattern:
;
; 	11001100
;	00110011
;	11110000
;	11110000
;	00001111
;	00001111
;	00110011
;	00110011
;
; So we need 8 bytes to fully define a "tile mask pattern". 1 byte per row.
;
; In a similar manner to the background, mask tiles and mask tile patterns are used.
; A whole "mask tile layer" is defined, with dimensions = room_width * room height.
; One mask tile index is stored per byte.
; Each tile index defines the tile pattern to be used as mask.
; 
; The mask tiles are stored in the same format as the background tiles.

; Bit 2		CHAREN signal - Select what's mapped at D000-DFFF. 1 = I/O registers or RAM bank, 0 = Character ROM
;				Whether I/O registers or a RAM bank are mapped, depends on the LORAM signal apparently (1 = I/O registers, 0 = RAM)
; Bit 1		HIRAM signal - Select what's mapped at E000-FFFF. 1 = KERNAL ROM, 0 = RAM
; Bit 0 	LORAM signal - Select what's mapped at A000-BFFF. 1 = BASIC ROM, 0 = RAM. Also controls mapping of I/O registers as explained above.
;
; 
; During the main execution of the game engine, KERNAL and BASIC ROMs are mapped out of the memory space permanently,
; and RAM banks are mapped in, in their place. The only range that is alternately mapped in and out is the I/O registers range.
; The range is mapped in only when the I/O registers are needed. The rest of the time, I/O registers are mapped out,
; and a RAM bank is mapped in instead.
;
; To perform these two primitives ("map in I/O" or "map out I/O"), the corresponding value needs to be written to the processor port.
; Bits 2-0 must be set to 101 to map in the I/O registers, and to 100 to map in a RAM bank at D000-DFFF.
; In the code, we will see repeated storage of #24 and #25 values to the processor port.
; Ignoring the hi nibble, the low nibble contains bits 2-0 as "101" in the case of #25, and "100" in the case of #24.
; 
; So, to summarize, writing #24 maps in RAM instead of the I/O registers.
; Writing #25 maps in the I/O registers instead of RAM.
; We'll just mention this as "map_out_io" or "map_in_io" as a comment.

;			(if the cursor is clicked inside the object's original location in a room, the object's location is ignored)

;			Special values for owners
;				#0F - in a room (no owner, it's in a room)
;				#0D = limbo
;				#01-07	- index of kid owner
;
;The only ownership that's actually checked in the game scripts is kid's ownership.
;Objects given to other characters are not "owned" by them. 
;In those cases, the change is handled by changing states of game variables.
;
;Some objects are in a "limbo" location before being materialized into the world.
;For instance, the batteries inside the portable radio.
;When the radio is picked up, the batteries are put in the limbo.
;When the radio is opened, the batteries owner changes from limbo to the current kid.
;
;Limbo is modeled by setting the owner for the object to #0D.
;#0D would be the owner index for the Green Tentacle, but in reality, it's limbo.
;In some cases, scripts set the owner of an object to #00 instead of #0D. It has the same effect.

;===========================================================
; Resource disk storage data
;===========================================================
;This includes all of the disk side, track and sector information for all resources.
;
;Let's call "disk location" as a specific disk side, track and sector combination.
;Room resources always start at the beginning of a sector.
;To read a room resource, a disk location then perfectly defines the exact place to start reading from.
;
;To avoid storing disk locations for every other resource (of which we have hundreds),
;a design decision was made to save some space: all non-room resources are "child" resources of a room.
;
;So, for example, to read sound X, the parent room needs to be looked up first.
;Then the location of the parent room is fetched.
;A room's data will normally occupy multiple sectors. Immediately after it, the child resources data will start.
;And that will very likely happen right in the middle of a sector.
;
;So to start reading a child resource directly, it's necessary to know:
;	-the parent room's disk location
;	-how many sectors from the room's data start to skip
;	-how many bytes in the resource's sector to skip
;
; I call the sectors skip "sector_index", and the bytes to skip "offset_in_sector".

;===========================================================
; Resource pointers and memory attributes
;===========================================================
;Memory attributes consist of a single byte.
;Bit 7 represents the locked state (set = locked, clear = unlocked).
;Locked resources cannot be released.
;Unlocked ones can be, if nedeed.
;For rooms, LRU (Least Recently Used) is used as the algorithm for eviction.
;The low nibble of the attribute represents an age for the resource.
;
;Resources other than rooms do not use LRU for eviction.
;
;When sound eviction is activated, all evictable sounds are released.
;The same thing applies to scripts.
;
;For costumes, only the first evictable costume is released, 
; counting downwards from the maximum costume index.
;
;Rooms memory age work as follows:
;
;	-When a room is loaded
;		-If the loaded room is the "current room" (the one where the player is present), its age is set to 0
;		-If the loaded room is not the current room, its age is set to 1.
;		This can happen if only a room's subresource (script, sound, etc.) was needed.
;		But subresources require loading a whole room.
;	-After a room is loaded, all loaded rooms with nonzero age have their age incremented by 1
;	-When a room is released, its age is set to 0

; Get the next decompressed byte
;
; Arguments:	decomp_dict4		dictionary of symbols
;				decomp_src_ptr		pointer to compressed data
;
; Returns:		.A					decompressed symbol
;
; This is the main generic decompression logic routine.
;
; Run length encoding allows compressing repetitions of a value.
; It's expressed as a run-length and a symbol to be repeated.
;
; The decompression algorithm combines run-length encoding (RLE)
; with a symbol dictionary of 4 elements.
;
; The dictionary's purpose is to hold the symbols having the highest frequencies.
; This allows using just 2 bits (for the 4 elements) to reference each symbol,
; while leaving the remaining bits of the byte to express a run length.
; This obviously saves space.
;
; We can partition the set of symbols into two groups:
;	-symbols in the dictionary
;	-symbols not in the dictionary
;
; Thus, runs can reference a dictionary symbol or an ad-hoc (non-dictionary) symbol.
;
; When using RLE doesn't make sense (because symbols are not being repeated), we need to
; store the symbols directly as in their original form. Otherwise, we would be 
; actually increasing the space needed.
;
; "Direct" mode is thus also needed to properly handle these cases.
 
; There are then 3 main operations defined:
;
;	-repeat an ad-hoc value				expressed as a run-length and the ad-hoc repeated symbol
;	-repeat a dictionary value			expressed as a run-length and the dictionary symbol index
;	-direct mode						expressed as a counter, followed by one or more symbols
;
; Bits 7 and 6 are used to differentiate between these three operations.
;
;	Bit 7 set				dictionary run
;								bits 6-5 represent the symbol index
;								bits 4-0 represent the run length
;	Bit 7 clear, 6 set		ad-hoc run
;								bits 5-0 represent the run length
;								The following byte represents the symbol
;	Bits 7 and 6 clear		direct mode
;								byte represents the direct "run" length (how many direct bytes follow)
;								Following bytes represent symbols
;
; Note that the symbol dictionary has to be set up first, before calling this routine.
; This is done via decomp_dict4_init.

;				#00 	if no script exists for the verb and the verb is not "Walk to"
;				#0D		if no script exists for the verb and the verb is "Walk to"
;				offset	if there's a script for the verb.
;						The offset refers to the verb script in the object resource.
;
; Verb handlers start in an object's resource from offset #0E.
; Each verb handler takes 2 bytes.
; The first byte represents the verb index.
; The second byte represents an offset within the object resource.
; The offset refers to the start of the script for the verb handler.
;
; For instance, a verb handler having bytes of 0A 43 would represent
; the verb handler for "Pull" (#0A) and an offset of 0x43 bytes from the object's resource start.
;
; Verb handlers are stored consecutively. 
; A value of #00 for the verb index is used to represent the end of the handlers list.
;
; A verb handler with a verb index of #0F is used as the default handler for all verbs.
; If found, it's considered a match for any verb.
;
; If there is no handler that matches the verb, #00 is returned.
; An exception is the "walk to" verb. If no handler matches it, #0D is returned.

; For each of the 8 sprites, allowed vertical positions are in the range 0-255, and so can be represented with a single byte.
; Horizontal positions are in the range 0-319, which cannot be represented with just 1 byte (8 bits). 
; With 9 bits, values can be represented in the range 0-512, which is enough for the intended 0-319 range.
; So, for the horizontal position (which we call "X"), 9 bits are needed. Bits 0-7 fit in one byte and bit 8 in another.
;
; To make more efficient use of storage, the VIC-II chip combines all the "bit 8"s of all sprites into a single register.
; There are also 8 sprites in total, so there are 8 bit 8s.
; We labelled this register "vic_sprite_x_msb_reg", which can be a bit cryptic if this explanation is not present.
; 
; So, for each of the sprites, whenever the bit8 of a given sprite needs to be set or cleared, 
; the corresponding bit in the "bit8" register needs to be set or cleared.
; This is done by these steps:
;		-determine the bit8 value based on the sprite's intended coordinate
;		-shift the value into position
;		-OR'ing the bit into the bitmask value that will later be copied to the "bit8" register
;
; Sprites 0-6 might change their relative position over time.
; When this happens, their relative bit positions should be kept in sync.
;
; Variables vic_sprite_idx_0 to vic_sprite_idx_6 track those changes
; and update their values accordingly.

; The walkbox is described by the coordinates of its four edges (left, right, top and bottom).
;
; The algorithm checks first if the horizontal coordinate (box_check_x)
; is outside or inside the box, by comparing against the left and right edges. 
;
; If it's outside, it selects the left or right edge accordingly as the closest coordinate.
; If it's inside, it selects the original coordinate (box_check_x) as the closest coordinate.
; The same logic is used for the vertical coordinates and edges.
;
; Once each of the two closest coordinates is determined, the distance between
; the closest coordinate and the original coordinate is computed.
; This is done with: |closest_coordinate - original_coordinate| (the absolute value).
;
; Finally, the two distances (X distance and Y distance) are compared.
; The scales of the horizontal and vertical axis are not
; identical, so distances are normalized before being compared.
;
; If x_distance > y_distance, then x_distance/2 + y_distance is returned.
; Otherwise, y_distance/2 + x_distance is returned.
;
; If a position is fully inside a box, the distance returned would be zero.

; Checks an actor's relative position against a target walkbox
;
; If the relative position is of the horizontal type, the checks will be done with the vertical position.
; If the relative position is instead vertical, the checks will be done with the horizontal position.
;
; This allows knowing if the actor would have to "turn a corner" if it tried to moved towards the destination in the target box,
; while keeping its position inside the boxes.
;
; For instance, consider the case where the adjacent target box is to the left of the current box.
; And both boxes have exactly the same vertical dimensions and are vertically aligned.
; If the actor is fully inside the current box and wanted to move left, it would not hit an obstacle,
; no matter its vertical position. It could move freely in a straight line to the destination position.
;
; 			|--------|=========|
; 			| target | current |
;		 	|--------|=========|
;					
; Now consider two adjacent boxes, but having different vertical dimensions.
;
; 			|--------|---------|	Row 0
; 			| target | current |	Row 1
;			|	     |    A    |	Row 2
;			|	     |---------|	Row 3
;		 	|--------|				Row 4
;
;	A = actor's current position
;
; If the actor is inside the current box and wanted to move left, to a destination inside the target box:
;		If the destination row is 0, 1, 2 or 3, there wouldn't be a problem, no obstacles would be hit.
;		If the destination row is 4, the trajectory would have to eventually go down (as the current box doesn't get to row 4).
;		While doing so, it can't escape the current box, as that's a constraint. Or any box, technically. 
;		So the correct trajectory would have to first find and hit the "corner" at the boxes adjacent's edge.
;
; This crude graphic tries to depict that scenario:
;
; 			|--------|---------|	Row 0
; 			| target | current |	Row 1
;			|	     |         |	Row 2
;			|	  ...C....A----|	Row 3
;		 	|---X..--|				Row 4
;
;	A = actor's current position
;	X = destination
;	C = "corner"
;	. = trajectory
;	Here, we see that the destination is on row 4. The trajectory has to first hit the corner marked with "C",
;	before freely going down to row 4.
; 
; More specifically, this routine tries to determine if the following scenario arises:
;
; 			|--------|          	
; 			| target |---------|	
; 			|--------| current |	
;				     |    A    |	
;				     |---------|	
;		 	          				
;	Here, the actor's vertical position is lower than the bottom edge of the target box.
; 	So it will definitely have to hit the "top left" corner of the current box before 
; 	being able to get to the target box.

; In this scenario, we see that the target box narrows down the space from A to X, both on the top and bottom edges.

;===========================================
; Blit and mask animation cell
;
; This routine will blit the pixels of a specific animation cell into the desired sprite buffer.
; It supports horizontal flipping, in case an animation cell needs to be flipped.
;
; The underlying logic for sprites is to blit them (copy them with transparency)
; into the final sprite buffer one by one, until a full sprite picture is formed.
; This allows an additive approach that eliminates redundancies.
;
; For instance, when a character is speaking, the only things that vary between frames are the mouth animation cells (open and closed).
; The rest of the head cell remains exactly the same.
; The simplistic approach would be to store:
;	1 - the full head with the mouth 
;	2 - the full head with the mouth closed
; ...but this wastes space.
;
; Instead, the smart approach used by the game is to store:
;	1 - the head cell without the mouth
;	2 - the mouth open cell
;	3 - the mouth closed cell
; Naturally, the mouth cells are much smaller in size than the head.
;
; The counterpart of saving space in this manner is that cells need to be pasted on top of each other accordingly to form the desired picture.
;
;	A regular C64 sprite has 24x21 pixels. This is a total of 504 pixels. At 8 pixels per byte (1 bit per pixel), it's a total of 63 bytes.
;	As the sprites used are in _multicolor_ mode, the number of bits per pixel increases from 1 to 2.
;	This allows specifying 4 colors per pixel instead of 2, but halves the effective horizontal resolution from 24 pixels to 12.
;	So a C64 _multicolor_ sprite has 12x21 pixels, or a total of 252 pixels. At 4 pixels per byte (2 bits per pixel), it's still 63 bytes.
;	Each row of 12 pixels then occupies exactly 3 bytes. 
;	Byte 0 defines pixels 0-3, byte 1 defines pixels 4-7 and byte 2 defines pixels 8-11.
;	Row pixel information is stored consecutively. And rows are stored consecutively as well.
;
;	The game's animation cells might use the full width of a sprite (all 12 pixels), or they might use just a portion of it.
;	Some cells use only one third and some use two thirds. For instance, arms, when viewed from the front, usually take only one third of the width.
; 	When this happens, it's a waste of space to store the 12 pixels. Instead, only the necessary portion is stored.
;	1 byte is used for 4 pixels (1/3 width), 2 bytes are used for 8 pixels (2/3 width), 3 bytes for all 12 pixels (full width).
;
; A cell's data format consists of a header followed by the cell's pixel bytes.
; 
;	Offset		Meaning
;	======		=======
;	#00			Bytes per row
;	#01			Vertical size
;	#02			Horizontal offset
;	#03			Vertical offset
;	#04			Unused
;	#05			Inter-cell vertical offset
;	<pixel bytes for row 0>		
;	...
;	<pixel bytes for row n>		
;
;	Bytes per row:	how many bytes per row are present. This can be in the range of #00 to #03, as explained before.
;					A value of #00 means that the cell pixel buffer is empty.
;
;	Vertical size:	how many rows does the cell take
;
;	Horizontal offset:	how many groups of 4 pixels to offset when rendering a row. This is needed when only 4 or only 8 pixels per row
;						are stored, instead of the full 12. When this scenario occurs, this tells the renderer how to horizontally offset
;						the row's pixels, to position the cell correctly.
;						The possible values for this offset are in the range of #00 to #02, as they are expressed in bytes (groups of 4 pixels).
;
;	Vertical offset:	how many rows to offset from the _bottom_ row of the full picture.
;						For instance, the head cell is drawn much higher than the legs.
;						The full picture vertical position remains constant when rendering different cells.
;						This value tells the renderer how to vertically offset each cell correctly.
;
;	Inter-cell vertical offset:	a vertical offset to apply to the _next_ cell drawn. Used rarely in a limited number of cells. 
;
;	After the header, the pixel bytes follow.
;
; 	If 3 bytes per row are used, then the format is:
;		Row 0 Byte 0, Row 0 Byte 1, Row 0 Byte 2,
;		Row 1 Byte 0, Row 1 Byte 1, Row 1 Byte 2,
;		...etc...
;
;	If 2 bytes per row are used, then the format is:
;		Row 0 Byte 0, Row 0 Byte 1
;		Row 1 Byte 0, Row 1 Byte 1
;		...etc...
;
;	And if 1 byte per row is used, then the format is:
;		Row 0 Byte 0
;		Row 1 Byte 0
;		...etc...
;
; 	When rendering a row of 3 bytes per row, the renderer has to simply copy the 3 bytes from source to destination.
; 
;	When 2 bytes per row are used, the renderer needs to know if it needs to:
;		-skip destination byte 0, copy source 0 into destination 1, copy source 1 into destination 2
;
;		Source bytes			Destination bytes
;		============			=================
;		S0 S1					D0 D1 D2
;					->
;		S0 S1					D0 S0 S1
;
;	or  -copy source 0 into destination 0, copy source 1 into destination 1, skip destination byte 2
;
;		Source bytes			Destination bytes
;		============			=================
;		S0 S1					D0 D1 D2
;					->
;		S0 S1					S0 S1 D2
;
;	This is exactly what the horizontal offset value is used for. 
;	The same situation occurs when using 1 byte per row.
;
; To save even more space, cells that are perfect mirror images of another are not actually stored in memory. 
; They are generated on the fly by doing horizontal "flipping".
; For instance, all of the head graphics for characters when "looking left" are flipped versions of the "looking right" versions.
; Only one of the two versions is stored (the "looking right" one) and the other is computed by flipping.
;
; This is done by using precomputed flipped values for all possible bytes. There are 256 possible values for each byte, representing 4 pixels.
; Each flipped counterpart for each of those 256 values is stored in an array.
; If the renderer knows it needs to flip a cell, it will use an alternative version of the copy logic.
; Instead of copying the bytes as-is, it will use the flipped versions.
;
; Once the row's 3 bytes are ready (by copying them directly or flipping them), the final step is to "mask" them onto the original sprite's data.
; This is analogous to the real-life hand-drawn celluloid animation compositing/overlay.
; The masking is performed by doing an AND of the pre-existing sprite byte using a bitmask to keep (some of the) original pixels.
; Then the result is OR'ed with the cell's row byte and written back.
;
; As an extra thing to consider, there are 4 variants of the copying, flipping and masking pieces of code.
; Each family of variants handles each of "X bytes per row" scenarios (1, 2 and 3), with an extra family that handles the 0 bytes per row scenario.
; 
; In fact, each family is a superset of another one. 
; The logic for 2 bytes per row includes the logic for 1 byte per row.
; The one for 3 bytes fully includes the logic for 2 bytes.
; And the one for 1 byte fully includes the logic for 0 bytes.
; 
; To speed up processing, the code is "repeated" (or inlined) instead of using a loop.
; So the function for 2 bytes uses part of the same code as the 3 bytes variant, only that the entry point skips the first byte.
; And so on.

;===========================================
; Animates an actor when it's walking
;
; Arguments: 	actor_motion_state
; 
; The logic is slightly convoluted and can be described as:
; -If the actor is stopped, it will exit
; -If the actor is about to stop, it will reset the animation state and exit
; -If the actor is standing/turning, it will update the motion state and set its standing limbs
; 	-If after that, its motion state hasn't changed, it will exit
;	-Otherwise, the motion state has changed to walking, so it will set its limbs for walking
;
; By this point, the actor is walking.
; -The low nibble of the motion state will be inspected to check if a traversal of an intermediate walkbox is ongoing
;	-If so, it will delegate traversal to the appropriate routine
;
; Otherwise, no ongoing walkbox traversal is occurring, so it's doing a "regular motion" (self-contained in a single walkbox).
; -It will finally perform an update of motion on the X and Y axis (to move towards the intended waypoint, regardless of it being intermediate or final)
; -If the waypoint position has been fully reached (on both axes), it will signal that the actor is about to stop
; -If it has been reached only on one axis and there are no walkbox traversals, it will return #00
; -If there's a walkbox traversal, it will set the delta directions bitmask based on the axis direction and then delegate to the traversal routine

; Updates an actor's motion along the X axis
;
; The algorithm used considers the total rate of motion along the X axis (path_delta_x)
; versus the total rate of motion on the dominant axis (path_delta_dominant).
;
; In case the dominant axis is the X axis, the rates will match. Otherwise, they might not.
;
; On each execution, the routine will determine if the "accumulated" rate of motion for the X axis matches or exceeds the dominant rate of motion.
; If that's the case, then motion along the X axis is needed, and the actor's position is updated accordingly.
; Also, the accumulated motion will get deducted the dominant motion, as the threshold has been exceeded and needs to be accounted for.
;
; If the accumulated rate has not exceeded the dominant rate, then the accumulated rate is updated accordingly and the actor's position is NOT updated.
; This represents the case in which the axis rate is lower than the dominant rate.

; Returns:	.A	#00		Waypoint X position not reached yet and no change of walkbox

; Compute pointers to the global mask indexes for the actor's sprites

;
; Returns:	global_mask_index_ptr_1		first pointer
;			global_mask_index_ptr_2		second pointer 
;			global_mask_index_ptr_3		third pointer
;
; In the code, we'll see this sequence of instructions:
;
;  ASL A
;  TAY
;  TXA
;  ROL A
;  TAX
;  TYA
;
; These are the effects of each of them:

; 
;
; If we had an ROL X instruction (which doesn't exist), then an equivalent, more readable, sequence of instructions would be:
;
;	ASL A
;	ROL X
;
; The net effect of these instructions is to move bit 7 of .A into bit 0 of .X, using .Y as a register to swap values around. 
; This is equivalent to a multiplication of .A by 2.
; The result is a 16-bit value, stored as .X/.A (hi/lo).
;
; By repeating this 3 times, we perform a multiplication of .A by 8.

;===========================================
; Setup room scene data
;
; This routine will allocate and populate a "room scene" resource (resource type #04, index #00).
; The resource will contain pointers to room scene layers for each column.
; There are 3 layers represented:
;
;		-the video matrix layer (which dot-character or tile to display)
;		-the color layer (how to color tile pixels)
;		-the mask layer (unknown purpose yet)
;
; These layers are stored compressed in the room resource. 
; To speed up the rendering process, some of the information needed to decompress them
; is pre-calculated and cached. This room scene resource is the cache itself.
;
; For each room column, the pointer to the exact start of the column's compressed data is stored,
; along with the initial decompression parameters. 

; This allows rendering individual columns quickly, which is useful when scrolling, as all existing
; columns (but one) are copied from one frame buffer to another in their new position. The final new column
; is rendered directly, and having the room scene resource facilitates this.
;
; As a consequence of this, there is no need to pre-render the whole room scene in memory. 
; Only visible columns are rendered. This saves a lot of memory for wider rooms.
;
; As there are three layers, three sets of compression metadata are precomputed and stored.
;
; Note: as there is only one room active (rendered) at any point in time, there's only one "room scene" resource.

; Calculate start address of each pointer byte list
;---------------------------------------------------
;
; As mentioned before, there are 3 sets of compressed data associated with a room (tile layer, color layer, mask layer).
;
; For any kind of compressed data, apart from the destination buffer, 4 bytes are needed to start a decompression:
;
;		-a pointer to the source data - src_lo and src_hi (2 bytes)
;		-an initial mode counter (1 byte)
;		-an initial value to repeat (1 byte)
;
; These can be summarized, for a single layer, as:
;
;		src_lo
;		src_hi
;		decomp_emit_rem
;		value_to_repeat
;
; These 4 values can be thought of as the initial state for the decompression state machine.
; By precomputing and saving the initial state for each room's column, the decompression can be started on arbitrary columns,
; instead of having to decompress the whole room at once. Thus saving some memory while allowing a relatively fast horizontal scroll.
; 
; The tradeoff is that each column's initial state has to be stored somewhere.
; That place is the "type 4A" resource of a room.
; It's simply a list of initial states, for each layer, for each column.
; 3 layers * 4 bytes per initial state = 12 values to store
; 12 values to store * 2 bytes per pointer for each value = 24 pointer bytes in total (or #18 in hexadecimal)
; Each column thus needs 24 pointer bytes.
;
; This would be the full list of 24 pointer bytes for a single column:
;
;	tile_layer_src_lo_ptr_lo
;	tile_layer_src_lo_ptr_hi
;	tile_layer_src_hi_ptr_lo
;	tile_layer_src_hi_ptr_hi
;	tile_layer_mode_counter_ptr_lo
;	tile_layer_mode_counter_ptr_hi
;	tile_layer_value_to_repeat_ptr_lo
;	tile_layer_value_to_repeat_ptr_hi
;	color_layer_src_lo_ptr_lo
;	color_layer_src_lo_ptr_hi
;	color_layer_src_hi_ptr_lo
;	color_layer_src_hi_ptr_hi
;	color_layer_mode_counter_ptr_lo
;	color_layer_mode_counter_ptr_hi
;	color_layer_value_to_repeat_ptr_lo
;	color_layer_value_to_repeat_ptr_hi
;	mask_layer_src_lo_ptr_lo
;	mask_layer_src_lo_ptr_hi
;	mask_layer_src_hi_ptr_lo
;	mask_layer_src_hi_ptr_hi
;	mask_layer_mode_counter_ptr_lo
;	mask_layer_mode_counter_ptr_hi
;	mask_layer_value_to_repeat_ptr_lo
;	mask_layer_value_to_repeat_ptr_hi

; The 24 bytes for each column are not stored consecutively in memory. 
; Instead, all values for the first pointer, for all columns, are stored consecutively first,
; then the second, and so on.
;
; This means:
; 
;	tile_layer_src_lo_ptr_lo_col_0
;	tile_layer_src_lo_ptr_hi_col_0
;	tile_layer_src_lo_ptr_lo_col_1
;	tile_layer_src_lo_ptr_hi_col_1
;		...
;	tile_layer_src_lo_ptr_lo_col_n
;	tile_layer_src_lo_ptr_hi_col_n
;	tile_layer_src_hi_ptr_lo_col_0
;	tile_layer_src_hi_ptr_hi_col_0
;	tile_layer_src_hi_ptr_lo_col_1
;	tile_layer_src_hi_ptr_hi_col_1
;		...
;	tile_layer_src_hi_ptr_lo_col_n
;	tile_layer_src_hi_ptr_hi_col_n
;
;	...and so on
;
; So there are 12 lists, one for each pointer byte. The lists themselves _are_ stored one after the other.
; To calculate where each of the 12 lists start, we simply need to add the number of columns to the previous base address.

; Process voice instructions
;
; This is the main decoder and executor of voice instructions.
; Instructions can be either repeatable or not.
; If an instruction is repeatable, a running count is started,
; and the routine processes the same instruction repeatedly until the count is over.
; After a repeatable instruction count is over, another instruction is read and executed.
;
; After the first non-repeatable instruction is executed, the routine returns.
;
; Repeatable instructions need to supply two operands:
;		-a repeat count
;		-an offset
;
; The offset is supposed to be a positive number, which gets subtracted from the
; instruction read pointer. Thus going back to previous data, from which the next instruction 
; will be processed (again). If the offset is misconfigured, obviously things will break.
;
; Summary of bit meanings
; =======================
;
; Bit 0 - trigger/release note (bit set = trigger, bit clear = release)
; Bit 1 - bit set - stop voice
; Bit 2 - change frequency, duration, glissando
;		-bit clear - clear duration and glissando
;		-bit set
;				-Read 2 bytes - set frequency
;				-Test bit 6 of original instruction
;					-Bit 6 set 
;						-clear duration and glissando
;					-Bit 6 clear 
;						-read 2 bytes - set as duration
;						-read another 2 bytes - set as glissando
; Bit 3 - change ADSR
;		-Bit set - change ADSR
;			-Read 2 bytes - set as ADSR
;			-Repeat note action (trigger/release)
; Bit 4 - change PWM (pulse width modulation), filter cutoff frequency, duration
;		-Read a byte -> instr_op_flags
;			Bit 0 set - set PWM (read 2 bytes as value)
;			Bit 1 set - set filter cutoff frequency (read 2 bytes as value)
;			Bit 2 set - set duration (read 2 bytes as duration)
; Bit 5 - change waveform
;			-Read 1 byte as waveform bitmask 
;			-OR the waveform bitmask into voice control
; Bit 6 - used by the "bit 2" section to enable/disable duration/glissando changes (already explained)
; Bit 7 - repetitions
;		-Details are explained in the relevant section

; This section will allocate and set up all the voices needed for the sound.
; Real voices (0, 1 and 2) need to be allocated so no other sound uses them concurrently.
; Virtual voices (4-7) are used to generate arpeggios.
; Special voice 3 is used to control filter and volume.
;
; Apart from selecting the correct available voices and doing allocation,
; setup is needed to prepare read pointers for each voice. 
; This takes the form of a base address and an offset, for each voice.
; The sound resource data contains the starting offsets for each voice, immediately following the voices_needed byte (offset #05).
; These offsets will be present for each associated needed voice.
; After these offsets, the sound data for the first voice will begin. So the offset for the first voice allocated is not needed.
;
; Byte #05 in the sound resource data contains a bitmask specifying which voices, and of which kinds, are needed to play the sound.
;
; With all bits clear, the default case of "1 real voice needed" is represented.
;
; For each extra voice needed, a bit is set.
; Bits 1 and 3 represent real voices.
; Bits 0, 2 and 4 represent virtual voices (used to arpeggio a sound).
;
; Bits 5 and 6 are 2 different bits that can be used to request special voice #3.
; If bit 6 is clear, one available real voice is allocated (which is the minimum for a sound).
;
; To summarize:
;	Bit 6 clear	- allocate 1 available real voice
;	Bit 6 set 	- allocate special voice #3
;	Bit 5 set 	- allocate special voice #3
;	Bit 4 set 	- setup virtual voice #.X + 4
;	Bit 3 set 	- allocate 1 available real voice
;	Bit 2 set 	- setup virtual voice #.X + 4
;	Bit 1 set 	- allocate 1 available real voice
;	Bit 0 set 	- setup virtual voice #.X + 4
;
; In observed real values, bit 6 is always clear.
; Virtual voices are expected to be requested always coupled with a real voice and not by themselves.
; And voice 3 is requested only using bit 5 (and not bit 6).

;===========================================
; The script allows referencing argument values of two kinds: the value of a variable or an immediate value (a constant).
;
; To avoid having duplicated code for each kind, a mechanism is used to differentiate between them.
; The opcode (the operation code) byte not only encodes the type of operation, but also the kind of value to be used.
;
; Specific bits of the opcode are used to specify the kind.
; Bits 7, 6 and 5 are used for this, which allows an operation to use up to 3 different "parameterizable kind" arguments.
;
; For example, most operations use bit 7 for an operand's kind.
; If bit 7 is set, a variable is used.
; If bit 7 is clear, an immediate value is used.
; Bits 6 and 5 are used in the same manner, depending on whether an operation needs more arguments like this or not.
;
; When a variable is used, the variable index is read from the script, to know which variable to use.
; When an immediate value is used, the value itself is read from the script.
;
; There are 3 operand load routines, one for each bit.
; For each of them, this logic applies:
;
;	The opcode is AND'ed with a bitmask for the bit position (0x80, 0x40 and 0x20 for bits 7, 6 and 5 respectively).
;	After performing the AND, the processor flags are set according to the result.
;	If A = 0 after the AND, the Z flag will be SET.
;	Thus when executing a BNE (Branch on Not Equal, which is equivalent to Branch if Z is CLEAR), the branch will NOT be taken.
;	This conditional branch instruction is performed in script_operand_type_check.
;	All 3 operand load routines end up using script_operand_type_check.
;	When the branch is taken, a variable is used.
;	When it's not taken, an immediate value is used.
;
;	So, to sum up, if the relevant bit in the opcode is SET, the AND yields non-zero, Z is clear, the branch of BNE is taken and a variable is used.
;	If the bit is CLEAR, the AND yields zero, Z is set, the branch of BNE is not taken, and an immediate operand is used.
;
; After reading the operand, it's returned in .A

;===========================================
; Comparison operations
;
; These operations perform an arithmetic comparison of a variable against an operand.
; This comprises the most usual ones: equal, not equal, greater than, etc.
; Script execution is altered based on the comparison result.
; 
; This can be thought of as:
;
; if (condition)
; then {
;		...code block...
;		}
;
; Note that there is no explicit "else" support from the engine. Thus, this can't be done directly:
;
; if (condition)
; then {
;		...code block...
;		}
; else {
;		...another code block...
;		}
;	...common code block... (executed regardless of the condition value)
;
; In the example above, there's a code block executed only if the condition is True, another that's executed only if the condition is False, and
; finally the rest of the code (which will be executed regardless of the condition). 
;
; As there is no "else" support, code following an "if/then" block will be _always_ executed.
;
; In order to simulate an "else"-like block, the script needs to have another "if", inverting the condition, like this:
;
; if (condition)
; then {
;		...code block...
;		}
; if (opposite condition)
; then	{
;		...another code block...
;		}
;
; Bottom line: the script engine needs to know where to continue executing in case the condition is False, to skip over the instructions
; that belong to the "condition is True" block. This is a relative offset that can be applied to the current execution pointer.
;
; So to fully represent a conditional operation, we need:
;
;	-the condition operation itself
;	-the first operand (a variable)
;	-the second operand (a variable or an immediate value)
;	-the condition-False offset
;
; The order in which these bytes appear is:
;
;	comparison_opcode 
;	comparison_operand1
;	comparison_operand2 (if applicable)
;	condition_false_offset
;	<condition-True code>
;
; The script engine will read the opcode and operands and perform the condition evaluation.
; If the condition is True, then the offset is not applied and the code to be executed follow immediately after.
; It only has to skip over the offset to get to the "condition-True" code.
;
; If the condition is False, then the offset needs to be read and applied (added).
;
; So if the condition is true, the conditional branch will be taken and the displacement will be skipped (a single byte).
; If the condition is false, the conditional branch is not taken, and the displacement is added.

;Note that the possible mask values are:
; 00, 01, 04, 05
; 10, 11, 14, 15
; 40, 41, 44, 45
; 50, 51, 54, 55
;
; This means that all the possible nibble values are: 0, 1, 4 and 5.
; 0 = all bits clear
; 1 = bit 0 set
; 4 = bit 2 set
; 5 = bits 0 and 2 set
;
; So for a low nibble, only bits 0 and 2 might be set.
; For the high nibble, bits 4 and 6 might be set accordingly.
; To sum up, only the even bits might be set in these masks.
; Doing the following AND operation: bitmask AND #55 ...
; ...doesn't have any net effect, as it keeps only even bits set.
; This will become relevant in the "apply_mask" subroutine, which uses these masks.
